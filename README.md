# PackSchedulerDemo

This project was something I turned in as a final semester long project for my Java class, as such under academic integrity I cannot post the code; however, I can showcase a demo of the project. This PackScheduler program is supposed to mimic a typical schedule for students, faculty, and the registrar (person who controls student, faculty, and class catalog for the enrollment wizard). This demo will showcase the enrollment wizard through the view of the registrar.
